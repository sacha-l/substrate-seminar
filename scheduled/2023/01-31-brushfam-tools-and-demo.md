## Description

Brushfam maintains critical tools for the ink! smart contract ecosystem, which serve the purpose of easing ink! smart contract development. These tools are widely used and known by the ink! community. We would like to introduce these tools for those who don't know about them yet, while also showcasing some development using these tools and answering potential questions. The tools we would mention are 
* OpenBrush: ink! smart contract library to ease the development of ink! contracts
* Typechain-polkadot: typescript wrapper around ink! smart contracts which can be used either in UI or typescript integration tests
* Sol2Ink: tool for easy migration from Solidity to ink!

## Topic

ink! smart contract development, openbrush

## Plan

* Introduction to Brushfam tools
* Easy migration from Solidity to ink! using Sol2Ink
  * Convert a Solidity smart contract to an ink! smart contract using Sol2Ink
* Utilizing OpenBrush macros and utilities in ink! smart contract development
  * Extend the smart contract generated in the previous part by some useful utilities
  * Create a new ink! smart contract utilizing OpenBrush
* Creating integration tests for ink! contracts using Typechain-Polkadot
  * Showcase how to test the previously generated contracts using Typechain-Polkadot. Reproducing these steps will also be useful for UI development
