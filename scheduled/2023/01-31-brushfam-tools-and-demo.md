## Description

Brushfam maintains critical tools for the ink! smart contract ecosystem, which serve the purpose of easing ink! smart contract development. These tools are widely used and known by the ink! community. We would like to introduce these tools for those who don't know about them yet, while also showcasing their use by building a simple voting dapp. 

Please join us on the live stream to ask questions and follow along the live coding. 

The tools we'll go over are:
* [OpenBrush](https://docs.openbrush.io/): ink! smart contract library to ease the development of ink! contracts
* [Typechain-polkadot](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot): typescript wrapper around ink! smart contracts which can be used either in UI or typescript integration tests
* [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink): tool for easy migration from Solidity to ink!

## Topic

ink! smart contract development, openbrush

## Plan

1. **Introduction to Brushfam tools**
  * OpenBrush: macros and utilities in ink! smart contract development
  * Typechain-Polkadot: tool to generate ABI for the contracts
  * Sol2Ink: a tool to convert a Solidity smart contract to an ink! smart contract

  
2. **Build a simple voting dapp**
  * Dapp logic and overview
  * Migrate a Solidity contract to ink! using Sol2Ink
  * Extend the smart contract with some useful utilities
  * Create a new ink! smart contract using OpenBrush
  * Create integration tests for ink! contracts using Typechain-Polkadot
  * Interact with dapp with minimal UI
