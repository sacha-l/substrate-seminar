### Description

Learn about the current tools available for spawning and testing Substrate based blockchains and what Zombienet provides to enable this. 
In this seminar, Javier (Parity Simulation Network Lead) will go through Zombienet's features and an overview of new features to come.

You will learn about different use cases for Zombienet and how you can spawn your own network and use Zombienet's testing framework to run your own tests.

### Topic

Testnets, integration tests, tools

### Plan

We will first talk about the current tools available for spawning/testing Substrate based blockchains and the origins of the Zombienet.
Then we will cover some of the frictions this tool helps overcome and the design considerations and decisions made when building it. 

Then, Javier will walkthrough the main features, divided in two phases (spawning and testing) and the features available in each one.

Finally, we will go over a demo and present some of the features to come.
