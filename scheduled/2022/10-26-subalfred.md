* ⚡️ Beginner / intermediate
* 👤 Presenter: Xavier
* 📆 Date scheduled: October 26, 2022

👉 [Join the livestream on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/substrate-seminar-2/26).

### Description

Learn how you can use SubAlfred's key utilities, whether you're a parachain developer or just getting started with Substrate.
SubAlfred provides parachain developers with a bunch of utilities for working with Substrate and testing runtime upgrades.

Some ideas that were initially proposed for this seminar's presenter to cover were:
* Runtime upgrades and how to _dry-run_ runtime upgrades
* Forking live chains/rewriting a chainspec with alice keys
* Querying for pallet prefixes

### Topic

Tools, Runtime migrations, Substrate utils

### Plan

The plan is to go over each command with real-world examples of usage.

The commands include:
* `check`
* `convert`
* `get`
* `hash`
* `key`
* `state`
* `storage-key`
* `workspace`

Xavier will go through this list, with a focus on using `convert` in a project's CI and how to use `state` on a template chain.
