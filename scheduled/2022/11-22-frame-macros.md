### Description

In this seminar, we are joined by Parity core FRAME developer, Sam who's been working some key FRAME macro features (see [#12536](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12536) and [#12536](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12536)). He  will be explaining the high level of how the FRAME pallet macro parsing and expansion works through the lens of implementing a simple pallet macro.

### Topic

FRAME macros

### Plan

1. A brief overview of what pallet macros are and where they are used.
2. A quick description of the `whitelist_storage` macro, what it is supposed to do, and why it should exist.
3. A general discussion about the "outer macro" pattern.
4. Going through the steps of implementing the `whitelist_storage` macro as a way of explaining how pallet macros are parsed and expanded.
5. (time permitting) How pallet macros are tested.
