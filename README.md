## ✅ Why have this repo?

* To get the community involved in suggesting new topics or discussing topics they'd like to study.
* To have a place for people to revisit content from past seminars for their own learning.
* For participants to prepare questions for upcoming seminars.
* For seminar guest presenters to share any materials they will be presenting and get feedback on their seminar proposals.

## 📚 How it works

* To **suggest a new topic**, just [make a new issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-seminar/issues/new) in this repo.
* To **discuss ideas for new seminars**, make an issue or comment on an existing one that's open.
* To **view past seminar** material, navigate to the `scheduled` folder to find the material you're looking for, sorted by scheduled date (dd-mm-seminarTitle).
* To **find resources and material** you may want to study in preparation for an upcoming seminar, navigate to the `scheduled` folder too.

### 🧐 How do I suggest a new topic?

To suggest a new topic, [make an issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-seminar/issues/new) with the topic idea and description. 
This should include a title, any relevant material and why you would be interested in this topic.

Once the topic is approved, it will be added to this list and a seminar organizer will ensure the presenter locks in a date.
Then, they can add any relevant materials to this folder to help participants prepare for the upcoming session.

### 👋 Who can suggest a new topic?

Anyone is welcome to, just open an issue!
